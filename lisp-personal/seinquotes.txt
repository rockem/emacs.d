"I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El-Clowno!"
 - George, in "The Visa"

 "You're a very very good man."
 - Babu to Jerry, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors, and have sex without dating. *That's* a fantasy camp!"
 - George, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Why don't we just put these two tables together?"
 "No no, you can't do that. They're round... it makes an eight...."
 - Elaine and George, who doesn't want any company on his date, in "The Visa" 
---
 "He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show and go see the other show."
 - Elaine, about George, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm askin'. This woman thinks I'm very funny and now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny."
 - George, to Jerry, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year's gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it's not to be. That for the rest of our sad, wretched, pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably. Happy birthday? No such thing."
 - Jerry, trying not to be funny, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Hey! I thought you weren't coming back 'til Monday!?"
 "Well, the camp ended a few days early."
 "Why?"
 "Well, there was an incident."
 "What happened?"
 "I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth."
 "What!?"
 "Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they cancelled the rest of the week."
 "You punched *who* in the mouth?"
 "Mickey Mantle."
 "What happened?"
 "Well, you know, we were playin' a game and I was pitching and I was really throwin' some smoke. And uh, Joe Pepitone, he was up and man, that guy... he was crowding the plate!"
 "Wow... Joe Pepitone!"
 "Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate! So I throw one inside, a little chin music... put him right on his pants, because I got to intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well, the next pitch, he's right back in the same place! So.... I had to plunk him."
 "You plunked him?"
 "Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound, next thing both benches are cleared, a brouhaha breaks out between the guys in camp and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off one of my teammates, somebody pulls me from behind and I turned around and I *popped* him! I look down and, whoa man! It's Mickey! I punched his lights out! Then Hank Bauer's screaming 'Mickey! Mickey! What have you have done with Mickey?! You killed Mickey!'" "So what did you do?"
 "I got the hell outta there!"
 - Jerry, Kramer and Elaine, as Kramer describes the fun he had at camp, in "The Visa" 
---
 "You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!!"
 - Babu, after finding out that Jerry is the reason he's being deported back to Pakistan, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!"
 - Babu's brother, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Snapple?"
 "No. Too fruity."
 - Elaine and Babu's brother, in "The Visa" 
---
 "It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail, anyway."
 "Elaine, that's what mail *is*. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there *is* no mail."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast."
 - George, trying to be witty, in "The Visa" 
---
 "The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the twenty-first century."
 - Elaine, imitating a snooty spokesmodel, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Do you ever laugh?"
 "Not really. Sometimes when I'm in the tub..."
 "That's so sad. What do you do?"
 "I'm a comedian."
 - Cheryl and Jerry, in "The Visa" 
---
 "Nobody is sicker than me."
 - George, in "The Visa" 
---
 "I am going to save up every rupee. For someday, I will get back to America, and when I do, I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget it. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. Very, very bad man."
 - Babu, blaming Jerry for his deportation to Pakistan, in "The Visa" 
---
"Jenna's like me. She's very..."
 "Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?"
 "I'll take fastidious."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'Holy cow', do they?"
 "Just the last few innings of a double-header."
 - Jerry and George. about Phil Rizzuto, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "Well, look at that. A talking Nixon."
 - Kramer, seeing George's Phil Rizzuto key chain, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "As of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway."
 - Kramer, in "The Pothole" "This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there."
---
 "At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage."
 "Quality time."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!"
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!"
 - Elaine, to the delivery boy, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "So the plan is to secretly sterilize her mouth?"
 "By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "So now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level."
 - Elaine, to Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder."
 "Disorder?"
 "And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "You could've introduced me."
 "I wouldn't know where to start."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet just to get this flounder?"
 "It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster."
 - Kramer, about the flounder, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "I just have to do all the jack-hammering myself."
 "Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labor fantasy camp."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
 "Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?"
 "For what?"
 "I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump."
 "Dirt? That's alright, because there's nothing wrong with dirt."
 "Well, actually it's pretty grimy."
 "Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery."
 "Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Pothole" 
---
"I'd rather be dating the blind. You know, you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her."
 "I think she'd figure it out."
 - George and Elaine, in "The Wink" 
---
 "Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?"
 "A healthy person."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
 "I still can't believe you're going out on a blind date."
 "I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking."
 "You're going by sound? What are we, whales?"
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Wink" 
---
 "So, what you are saying is that ninety to ninety-five percent of the population is undateable?"
 "Undateable!"
 "Then how are all these people getting together?"
 "Alcohol."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
 "Pulp can move, baby!"
 - George, in "The Wink" 
---
 "Women don't respect salad eaters."
 - Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
 "We reversed positions so there was no funny business."
 "Reversed positions?"
 "Yeah, you know, head to toe."
 "So what, your genitals are still lined up."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
 "So, is the chop the way you like it?"
 "I usually like mine with an angioplasty."
 - Holly and Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
 "Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?"
 "Uh, sometimes I use the sofa."
 - Holly and Jerry, in "The Wink" 
---
"What was that look?"
 "What look?"
 "The look you just gave me."
 "I gave a look?"
 "Yes."
 "What kind of look?"
 "I know that look."
 "Then what was it?"
 "Why should I tell you?"
 "Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are."
 "Trust me, I know the look."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
 "I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated."
 "It's almost stupid if we didn't."
 "It's moronic."
 "Absurd!"
 - Jerry and Elaine, contemplating a new sexual relationship, in "The Deal" 
---
 "Sometimes when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that."
 - Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
 "I slept with Elaine last night."
 "Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major!"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Deal" 
---
 "You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!"
 - George, to Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
 "That's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door. They'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face."
 - George, in "The Deal" 
---
 "It pains me to say this, but I may be getting too mature for details."
 - Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
 "Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done. Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done."
 - George, to Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
 "I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide... You're not going anywhere."
 - George, in "The Deal" 
---
 "I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it."
 - Jerry, about Elaine, in "The Deal" 
---
 "What about candle holders?"
 "Too romantic."
 "Lingerie?"
 "Too sexual."
 "Waffle maker?"
 "Too domestic."
 "Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?"
 "Too gubernatorial."
 - George and Jerry, looking for a gift for Elaine, in "The Deal" 
---
 "Who are you, my uncle?"
 - Elaine, to Jerry after he gives her cash for her birthday, in "The Deal" 
---
 "No this. No that. No this or that. Oh boy, what do you want?"
 "This, that, and the other."
 "Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?"
 "You."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Deal" 
---
 "What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?"
 "It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Deal" 
---
"Yo-Yo Ma!"
 - Kramer, suffering the ill effects of a kick to the head, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "I'm not taking a cab."
 "I'll pay for it."
 "It's not the money."
 "Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The speed? The convenience?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Ticket" 
---
"You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!"
 - Newman, to Kramer, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "Why didn't you shave this morning?"
 "Because I shaved yesterday in the afternoon."
 "Why?"
 "Because of the day before. It's a long story."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "I was never able to become a banker."
 - Kramer, inventing a story with Newman, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation."
 - George, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there."
 - George, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "Yes, I admit I was speeding, but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved, and to be a banker."
 - Newman, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?"
 "He's somebody."
 "What about me?"
 "You're nobody."
 "Why him? Why not me?"
 "He's good, you're not."
 "I'm better than him."
 "You're worse, much much worse."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Ticket" 
---
 "You know, a muffin can be very filling!"
 - Jerry, in "The Ticket" 
---
"Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things."
 "You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it, so it turned against you. Same thing happened to the Blob."
 - Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "I only eat cantaloupe at certain times."
 - Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in."
 - Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "It's like I was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get through the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She's firing at me from the guard tower: 'Son of a bang! Son of a boom!' I get to the top of the wall, the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away. I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!"
 - George, describing his break-up to Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?"
 - Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "I hate the little room."
 - George, at the doctor's office, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says."
 "Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "The apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
 - Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?"
 - George, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
 "I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night."
 "Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?"
 "I saw your act."
 "My act? What does that have to do with anything?"
 "Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff."
 "I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?"
 "I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do."
 "You're a cashier!"
 "Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor."
 "You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible."
 "I heard the material."
 "I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend."
 - Marlene and Jerry, in "The Ex-Girlfriend" 
---
"You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?"
 - Jerry, to Kramer, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "All bald people look good in hats."
 "You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then."
 "What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew."
 - George and Elaine, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems."
 - Kramer, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault. It's a vault!"
 - Jerry, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on."
 - George, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "You don't understand. A garage... I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free?"
 - George, looking for a parking spot, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "How I wish you could make a living parallel parking."
 - George, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "You're looking tremendous. What, are you on some kind of regimen?"
 "Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me. They take it down another fifteen percent."
 - Mike and Jerry, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "I thought you said you were a good driver!"
 "No no, I never said I was a good driver. I said I was a good parker."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "You gotta open the vault."
 "Open my vault?"
 "Open your vault."
 "Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault."
 "You have no choice."
 "Oy ga-vault."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
 "You want to know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. Because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law."
 - Newman, in "The Parking Spot" 
---
"Who are you gonna eat to survive?"
 "Kramer."
 "So fast? What about me?"
 "No."
 "Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy."
 "Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you."
 "Well, I would eat you."
 "That's very nice, I guess."
 "I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend."
 "Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you."
 "Thank you."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "I can do six weeks standing on my head. I'm a sexual camel."
 - George, who will have to abstain from sex, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?"
 - Jerry, at his old junior high, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "So you're enjoying the not enjoying."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "What is with all these books?"
 "I stopped having sex."
 - Elaine and George, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. It's not complicated."
 - George, to Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "My face is all craggly, it's crinkly!"
 "It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in seventy-two hours. What did you expect?"
 "Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face."
 "And your teeth, your teeth are all brown."
 "Look away, I'm hideous."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor."
 - Ben, to Elaine, in "The Abstinence" 
---
 "This is the most public yet of my many humiliations."
 - Jackie Chiles, in "The Abstinence" 
---
" 'Fax me some halibut.' Is that funny? Is that a joke?"
 - Jerry, trying to read his scribbled note, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed."
 - George, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body."
 - Jerry, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "Boy, they've got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!"
 - Kramer, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm."
 - George, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly."
 - Jerry, at the holistic healer, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? Yuck, I don't think so."
 - Elaine, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
 "That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming globes of Sigmond! That's my note! That's what I thought was so funny? That's not funny. There's nothing funny about that."
 - Jerry, in "The Heart Attack" 
---
"She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon."
 - George, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Explain to me how this baby shower thing works."
 "What do you wanna know?"
 "Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?"
 "Rarely."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Someday, before I die, mark my words... I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do."
 "And if you do?"
 "I still won't be able to forgive myself, but at least it won't be about this."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Man, it's the nineties... It's Hammer time!"
 - Kramer, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "You're wearing the chocolate shirt!"
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything."
 - Kramer, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason."
 - Jerry, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
 "Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all. Is that irony?"
 - George, in "The Baby Shower" 
---
"It's supposed to be a good party."
 "What does that mean? Good dip?"
 "No, there'll be girls there."
 "There's girls everywhere.
---
 I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.
---
 They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "You got aloe?
---
 I love aloe."
 - George, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "What could possess anyone to throw a party?
---
 I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room."
 - Jerry, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.
---
 In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it."
 "How old are you?"
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "So what do you do?"
 "I'm a comedian."
 "Are you?
---
 Let me ask you something.
---
 Where do you get your material?"
 "I hear a voice."
 "What kind of voice?"
 "A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator."
 "How come you keep tapping your head?"
 "It's a nervous tic.
---
 I'm on L-Dopa."
 - Party guest and Jerry, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "I can't believe what's happening here.
---
 She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.
---
 She was always friendly around the office, but that was it!"
 "How do you account for this?"
 "I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "Maybe the dingo ate your baby."
 - Elaine, to an annoying party guest, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her."
 - George, in "The Stranded" 
---
 "Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.
---
 I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.
---
 Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.
---
 If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day."
 - George, in "The Stranded" 
---
"Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happening here."
 - Elaine, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "It's very hard being a stand-up comedian. Sometimes they don't laugh!"
 - Elaine, apologizing for Jerry, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps. Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!"
 - Kramer, disdainful of public golf courses, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot... You're toiling in virtual anonymity."
 - George, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "Wear some more lipstick."
 - Mr. Ross, insulting his wife, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "Cherish the cabin."
 - Mr. Ross, recalling his father's final words, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
 "Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties and they're all laid out for me."
 - Elaine, to Jerry, in "The Cheever Letters" 
---
"If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you."
 "She's pretty. She's not beautiful."
 "I should drop dead if she's not beautiful."
 "I think that's a little extreme."
 - Helen Seinfeld and Jerry, about a waitress, in "The Watch" 
---
 "Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me."
 - George, in "The Watch" 
---
 "Have we been intimate?"
 - Kramer, to Elaine, pretending to be her boyfriend, in "The Watch" 
---
 "You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?"
 - Helen, to Jerry, in "The Watch" 
---
 "You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check."

 "You have a decaf cappuccino?"
 "I don't think we have that."
 "Well, that's a little strange."
 - Kramer and Dr. Reston, in "The Watch"

 "You know why fish are so thin?"
 "Why?"
 "They eat fish."
 - Jerry and Naomi, in "The Watch" 
---
 "Let me see if I understand this. In other words, you held out for... less money."
 "I was wrong, you were right."
 "You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go up."
 "You're smart, I'm dumb."
 "You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Watch" 
---
 "How could anybody not like you?"
 - Helen, to Jerry, in "The Watch" 
---
"I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it."
 - George, about receiving a massage, in "The Note" 
---
 "I can't get a massage from a man."
 - George, in "The Note" 
---
 "What if something happens?"
 "What could happen?"
 "What if it felt good?"
 "It's supposed to feel good."
 "I don't want it to feel good."
 "Then why get the massage?"
 "Exactly!"
 - George and Elaine, in "The Note" 
---
 "A man gave me a massage."
 "So?"
 "So he had his hands and, uh, he was..."
 "He was what?"
 "He was... touching and rubbing."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Note" 
---
 "I think it moved."
 - George, in "The Note" 
---
 "Maybe it just wanted to change positions. You know, shift to the other side."
 "No, no. It wasn't a shift. I've shifted. This was a move."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Note" 
---
 "Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?"
 - Kramer, in "The Note" 
---
 "I've always been a stall man."
 - George, in "The Note" 
---
 "I'm not happy."
 "Me neither. I've never been happy."

 - Jerry and George, in "The Note" 
---
 "Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle."
 "Of what? Oh."
 "And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say 'Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!' " - George and Elaine, in "The Note" 
---
"I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine."
 - Morty Seinfeld, in "The Pen"

 "Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends."
 "He's an idealist."
 - Morty and Helen, about Jerry, in "The Pen"

 "What kind of pen is that?"
 "This pen?"

 - Jerry and Jack Klompus, in "The Pen" 
---
 "Come on, take the pen!"
 "I can't take it."
 "Do me a personal favor!"

 "I cannot take it!"
 "Take the pen!"
 "Are you sure?"
 "Positive! Take the pen!"
 "Okay. Thank you very much."
 - Jack and Jerry, in "The Pen"

 "If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
 "He didn't think you'd accept."
 "Well, he was wrong."
 - Jerry and Helen, in "The Pen" 
---
 "It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tomorrow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Pen" 
---
 "I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule."
 - Jerry, in "The Pen" 
---
 "It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Pen" 
---
 "You're going underwater?"
 "Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done."
 "What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?"
 "What's so special up here?"
 - Helen and Jerry, in "The Pen"

 "Mrs. Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on."
 "You're hot?"
 "I've lost six pounds."
 "I don't even know how to work it."
 - Elaine and Helen, in "The Pen" 
---
 "What is going on in this community? Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humidity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?!"
 - Jerry, to his parents, in "The Pen" 
---
 "Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you."
 - Uncle Leo, to Jerry, in "The Pen"

"It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship."
 "I tell you how much I make."
 "And I'm always impressed."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior."
 - Kramer, after learning how much money Jerry makes, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men."
 - George, in "The Cadillac"

 "I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting."
 - Kramer, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "I'm a good son."

 - Helen Seinfeld, in "The Cadillac"

 - Jerry, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?"
 "That's your boyfriend."
 "What does he do?"
 "He's an importer."
 "Just imports? No exports?"
 "He's an importer-exporter. Okay?"
 - Elaine and George, working on his alibi, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "Are you having an affair with Elaine?"
 - Susan, not believing George's story, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?"
 "By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five."
 - Jerry and Mort Seinfeld, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a couple of bucks, I'll tell you that!"
 - Jerry, in "The Cadillac" 
---
 "So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald and so quirky and funny... how is it you're not taken?"
 - Marisa Tomei, to George, in "The Cadillac"

---
"So, it's a two-bedroom one-bath make-your-friends-hate-ya?"
 - Jerry, about George's new apartment, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "They like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers."
 - Jerry, about Elaine's blind date, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Did you find out who stabbed him?"
 "Yeah, it turns out it was his ex-girlfriend."
 "Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore."
 "Well, I don't know. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I mean, to be stab-worthy. You know, it's kind of a compliment."
 "Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line. Plus, they botched my vasectomy."
 "They botched it?"
 "I'm even more potent now!"
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Hawaii... The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to lick the stamps."
 - Newman, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "He's a bad breaker-upper."
 "Bad how?"
 "Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Ahoy, Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria."
 "Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal."
 "I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence?"
 "We had to abandon ship."
 "Well, all vacations have to end eventually."
 "The boat sank."
 "According to this, it took ten hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath, no offense."
 - George and Mr. Eldridge, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "You've got a big head. It's too big for your body."
 - Alan, to Elaine, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Even if he did suffer, that was, like, forty years ago! What has he been doing lately? I've been suffering for the past thirty years up to and including yesterday!"
 - George, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home. My home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys."
 - Jerry, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "Just crease, crumple, cram. You'll do fine."
 - Newman, giving Jerry advice on mail delivery, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
 "A bird ran into my giant freak-head."
 "What giant freak-head?"
 "The one that sits atop my disproportionately puny body. I'm a walking candy apple!"
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Andrea Doria" 
---
"Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute."
 "That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "When the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily."
 - Jerry, about Elaine's new friend, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews."
 "Oh, like you really know busboys."
 "Oh, like you do."
 "Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
 "Camp."
 "It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "Try not to say too much."
 "What am I gonna say?"
 "I don't know."
 "Well, I'm not an idiot."
 "Certainly not."
 "Then we're cool."
 - George and Kramer, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "Cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later. You never know. They've got things in their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you've gotta worry about."
 - Kramer, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "If I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me."
 - Elaine, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "Anywhere in the city?"
 "Anywhere in the city. I'll tell you the best public toilet."
 "Okay. Fifty-Fourth and Sixth."
 "Sperry Rand Building. Fourteenth floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name, she'll give you the key."
 "Alright. Sixty-Fifth and Tenth."
 "Are you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Busboy" 
---
 "I never knew I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold medal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there. And then, I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this... I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs."
 - Elaine, in "The Busboy" 
---
"When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy."
 - George, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "How do you oversleep at the Olympics?"
 "Oh, I know. I know."
 "I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, six alarm clocks, paying off little kids in the village to come banging on your door."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock."
 - Jerry, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "I can't come up with anything for this thing."
 "Ah... catalog writer's block?"
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "Hey, you bastards."
 "Hey, how was the meeting?"
 "I really like those sons of bitches."
 "Sons of bitches?"
 "Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "Jerry, look how tense you are. You need to take a soak."
 "I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria vat you got goin' there."
 "Come on, I'm telling you, it's great. I opened up all the windows. The air is cold, the tub is boiling hot. It's like Sweden, man. Sweden!"
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "What happened to your mental alarm?"
 "I guess I hit the snooze."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
 "We all get a little cuckoo sometimes, George. I used to be like you. Berating personnel until they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George... Hot Tub!"
 - George Steinbrenner, in "The Hot Tub" 
---
"I have to dribble. If I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker."
 "Oh, I'm a chucker."
 "That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot."
 "I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker. I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!"
 - Jerry, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I snuck a peak."
 - Kramer, to Jerry and George, after they showered at the gym, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have."
 - Jerry, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I'd love to be a Civil War buff. What do you have to do to be a buff?"
 "So Biff wants to be a buff? Well, sleeping less than eighteen hours a day would be a start."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Jerry, he's a guy."
 - Elaine to Jerry, who is concerned about making a good impression on his new friend Keith Hernandez, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I got a gum guy!"
 - George, to unemployment office worker, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "You've got to see the baby! When are you going to see the baby? Can't they just send us a tape?"
 - Elaine, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way from that day forward."
 - Newman, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "That must've been one magic loogie."
 - Jerry, during a reenactment of the spitting incident with Kramer and Newman, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I'm Vandelay Industries?"
 "Right."
 "And what is that?"
 "You're in latex."
 "Latex? And what do I do with latex?"
 "You manufacture it."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "What kind of a shake does he have?"
 "Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard. You know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there."
 - George and Jerry, talking about Keith Hernandez, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you?"
 - Jerry, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Vandelay! Say Vandelay!"
 - George, running from the bathroom after Kramer answers Jerry's phone, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "And you want to be my latex salesman."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Elaine, you don't know the first thing about first base."
 "Well, I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there."
 "The way I figure it I've already been there, and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock."
 "Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in."
 - Keith and Elaine, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "I would really like to have sex with a tall woman."
 - George, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
 "Magellan? You like Magellan?"
 "Oh yeah, my favorite explorer. Around the world, come on. Who do you like?"
 "I like DeSoto."
 "DeSoto? What did he do?"
 "Discovered the Mississippi."
 "Oh, like they wouldn't have found that anyway."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Boyfriend" 
---
"You're a shmoopy."
 "You're a shmoopy."
 - Sheila and Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
 - Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "The guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi."
 "Why? What happens if you don't order right?"
 "He yells and you don't get your soup."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments."
 - Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "He gave you the nice face discount."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
 "Bread, two dollars extra."
 "Two dollars? But everyone in front of me got free bread."
 "You want bread?"
 "Yes, please."
 "Three dollars!"
 "What?"
 "No soup for you!"
 - George and the Soup Nazi, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Why can't we share?"
 "I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you."
 "Do you hear yourself?"
 "I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are."
 - Kramer, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Shhh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode."
 - George, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "You're pushing your luck, little man."
 - The Soup Nazi, to George, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, Scent Of A Woman? Hoo-wah! Hoo-wah!"
 "Very good. Very good."
 "Well, I ..."
 "You know something?"
 "Hmmm?"
 "No soup for you!"
 "What?"
 "Come back one year. Next!"
 - Elaine and the Soup Nazi, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Street toughs took my armoire?"
 - Elaine, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
 "It was a bisque."
 "Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody."
 - Elaine, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "You are the only one who understands me."
 "You suffer for your soup."
 - The Soup Nazi and Kramer, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "Well, behind every joke there's some truth."
 "What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says, 'Ah, I'll just have some coffee.' There's no truth to that."
 - Sheila and Jerry, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
 "You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!"
 - Elaine, in "The Soup Nazi" 
---
"Oh man, did you see that? I ate discarded food!"
 "Well, I've done that."
 "Yeah, but with you it's intentional."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "I'm grotesque. I look like a troll."
 - George, about the doodle, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "I want you to find out if she likes me."
 "Find out if she likes you? What, are you in high school?"
 - George and Elaine, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "It's like having a circus in my mouth."
 - Kramer, eating Mackinaw peaches, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "I used to have fleas."
 "What did you do about them?"
 "What do you mean?"
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "When he's dead he'll be relieved."
 - Jerry, about George, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "She said looks aren't that important to her."
 - Elaine, to George, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "See, the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around but they don't know they're ugly because nobody actually tells them."
 - Jerry, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "The point, George, is she likes you."
 "Oh, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking."
 - Elaine and George, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "I know the chunky that left these Chunkies! Newman!"
 - Jerry, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "So you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor."
 - Newman, to Jerry, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "You could drape yourself in velvet for all I care."
 - Paula, to George, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "Well, it's a story of love, deception, greed, lust, and unbridled enthusiasm."
 - Kramer, describing the book he read, in "The Doodle" 
---
 "I've been searching for someone a long time. Well, the search is over!"
 "And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Doodle" 
---
"It was like my own personal Crying Game."
 - George, after seeing his father's breasts, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?"
 - Jerry, to Kramer, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "You want me to wear a bra?"
 "No, no, a bra is for ladies. Meet the Bro!"
 - Frank and Kramer, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "Bro's no good. Too ethnic."
 "You got something better?"
 "How about the Mansiere?"
 "Mansiere."
 "That's right. A brassiere for a man."
 - Frank and Kramer, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "He's a comedian, Mrs. Payton. They don't know how to do anything."
 - Elaine, about Jerry, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies."
 - Jerry, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "Say you're getting intimate with a woman, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there. I think we've all experienced that."
 - Kramer, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?!"
 "No no no, the cushion was turned over."
 "But the very idea. You had me lying in urine."
 - Frank and George, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!"
 - Estelle, after seeing Frank trying on the Bro, in "The Doorman" 
---
 "You're not having dinner with a bra salesman!"
 "He only sells them, he doesn't wear them."
 - Frank and Estelle, in "The Doorman" 
---
"Well, Jerry, I've been thinking. I've gone as far as I can go with George Costanza."
 "Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?"
 "The nickname... George, what is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
 "You mean like Liza!"
 "I was thinking T-Bone."
 "But there's no T in your name. What about G-Bone?"
 "There's no G-Bone."
 "There's a G-Spot."
 "That's a myth."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Maid" 
---
 "Are you sure you don't have one, because there's a lot of stuff in my apartment I've never seen."
 "Then maybe you have a fax machine."
 "You just blew my mind."
 - Kramer and Elaine, in "The Maid" 
---
 "There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum."
 - Elaine, to Jerry, in "The Maid" 
---
 "Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic."
 "You know, I could've killed you and no one would've known."
 "I could've killed you and no one would've known."
 - Phone repairman and Elaine, in "The Maid" 
---
 "You're sleeping with the maid?"
 "Yes."
 "I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Maid" 
---
 "Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as..."
 "Koko the monkey."
 - George and Kruger, in "The Maid" 
---
 "What did I just pay for?"
 "Uh-oh, you're a John."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Maid" 
---
 "What a nightmare it must be to have a real family."
 - Elaine, in "The Maid" 
---
 "What street are you on?"
 "I'm on First and First. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe!"
 - Jerry and a lost Kramer, in "The Maid" 
---
"You have any pets?"
 "Just my next-door neighbor."
 - Gavin and Jerry, in "The Dog" 
---
 "I'm telling you, the guy's a drunk. He's probably on a bender."
 "What is a bender anyhow?"
 "I don't know. They drink and they bend things at the bar."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Dog" 
---
 "Two-hundred seats on a plane and I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo!"
 - Jerry, in "The Dog" 
---
 "Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
 - Jerry, to Farfel the dog, in "The Dog" 
---
 "You're breaking up?"
 "Oh yeah! The sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether or not you're gonna hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. Boy, I'd like to get it on video. Watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it!"
 - Kramer, in "The Dog" 
---
 "I relate to George through you. We're more like friends-in-law."
 - Elaine, to Jerry, in "The Dog" 
---
 "I must've been out of my mind! Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? You sit around here all day. You contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? I wouldn't respect myself."
 - Kramer, to Ellen, in "The Dog" 
---
 "That's it Farfel. Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys, buddy boy. You're checking out!"
 - Jerry, in "The Dog" 
---
 "Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them for a week and then if no one claims them, they kill 'em."
 "Really? How late are they open?"
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Dog" 
---
 "I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit."
 - Elaine, about Ellen, in "The Dog"

 - Elaine, to Gavin, in "The Dog" 
---
 "I wanted to talk about how we had nothing to talk about."
 - Elaine, about George, in "The Dog" 
---
"Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter's obviously impossible, the former still applies."
 - Jerry, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---
 "All those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their big muscular arms on machines and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is."
 - Elaine, being sarcastic to Jerry, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---
 "I think we really need to be in front of the television set. You take TV out of this relationship, it is just torture."
 - George, to his mother Estelle, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---
 "I'm out there, George."
 "You're not out there."
 "I am too."
 "You're not out there. You can't be because I am out there. And if I see you out there there's not enough voltage in this world to electro-shock me back into coherence."
 - George and Estelle, who is dating again, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---

 "It's Fusilli Jerry! It's made from fusilli pasta. See the microphone?"
 "When did you do this?"
 "In my spare time. You know, I'm working on one of you George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual."

 "Because you're silly. Get it?"
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Fusilli Jerry"

 - Kramer, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---
 "Have you ever met a proctologist? They usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. Plant yourself there because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they stuck something up there. Never. It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way... 'It was a million to one shot, doc, million to one.' " - Kramer, in "The Fusilli Jerry" 
---
 "You know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex."
 - Jerry, in "The Fusilli Jerry"

 - George and Jerry, in "The Merv Griffin Show"

 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Merv Griffin Show" 
---
 "I am going to sidle the sidler."
 "You sidle? You stomp around like a Clydesdale."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Merv Griffin Show" 
---
 "I don't get these birds. They're breaking the deal. It's like the pigeons decided to ignore me."
 "So they're like everyone else."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Merv Griffin Show" 
---
 "Wait a minute. You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys?"
 - Kramer, to Jerry, in "The Merv Griffin Show" 
---
 "Jerry, now what you do with your personal life is your business. But when you're on my set, you clean it up mister!"

 "I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
 - Kramer and Newman, in "The Merv Griffin Show"

 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "Hey Kramer."
 "Hey, you got some messages. Yeah, uh... George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine... Newman, but that was a crank call."
 - Kramer, to Jerry, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "She does stink. And she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route. Years of rejection and failure until she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry."
 - Jerry, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "You know what woman I always thought you looked like? Lena Horne."
 - Kramer, to Jerry, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "And you must... look exactly like Jerry."
 - Kramer, to George's new girlfriend Janet, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "C'mon George, relax. Just because they look alike that doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry."
 - Kramer, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "What do I need to talk for, huh? What, to blab to the neighbors about how George has a new femme Jerry friend? To tell everybody at the coffee shop how George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend? See now, I've done all that. Now it's time for silence."
 "Silence, yes!"
 - Kramer and George, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "He said I could submit some of my own cartoons."
 "Wow, that's incredible. But you don't draw."
 "I do too."
 "What, your sad little horsies? The house with the little curl of smoke? The sunflower with the smiley face. The transparent cube."
 "It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane."
 "Where did you see that?"
 Those are private!"
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Cartoon"

 - Janet and George, in "The Cartoon" 
---
 "You ripped off a Ziggy?"
 "It must've seeped into my subconscious. Puddy has Ziggy bedsheets."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Cartoon" 
---
"First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep... Suddenly you're on your back like a turtle."
 - George, about car salespeople, in "The Dealership" 
---
 "So Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 'grease monkey.'" "I don't care for that term."
 "Oh sorry, I didn't know."
 "I don't know too many monkeys that can take apart a fuel injector."
 - Jerry and Puddy, in "The Dealership" 
---
 "Hey Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?"
 "The squinting?"
 "No."
 "The staring?"
 "No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five."
 "I thought all guys do that."
 "Slapping hands is the lowest form of primate ritual."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Dealership" 
---
 "What do you think the Nazis were doing? That was the Heil-five."
 "Isn't that from your act, like ten years ago?"
 "It was a good bit in the eighties and it's still relatable today."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Dealership" 
---
 "I think I've reached a point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie."
 - George, in "The Dealership" 
---
 "You are one sick momma. I like it!"
 - Kramer, to a car salesman, in "The Dealership" 
---
"Again with the sweatpants?"
 "What? I'm comfortable."
 "You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweatpants? You're telling the world, 'I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.'" - Jerry and George, in "The Pilot" 
---
 "God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'll never let me be happy."

 "You didn't go?"
 "No, and now I can't get it back."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Pilot" 
---
 "What is she like? Tell me about her."

 - TV Elaine and Jerry, on the real Elaine, in "The Pilot" 
---
 "So if you've got any other problems, whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dry fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, okay?"
 - TV Kramer, to George, in "The Pilot" 
---
 "It may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus."
 - Jerry, to Kramer, in "The Pilot" 
---
 "Listen, I know we've had our problems in the past, but we've got a show to do tonight. Pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins. They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange thing to do, to walk into a room, audition, and walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always open. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins, have a nice laugh."
 "How'd you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now and shoved it down your throat?"

 "What kind of a man are you?"
 "I'm a man who respects a good coma."
 - Gina and Jerry, in "The Suicide" 
---
 "I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?"
 - Jerry, in "The Suicide" 
---
 "The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?"
 "I didn't know what the coma etiquette was."
 "There is no coma etiquette. See, that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it."
 "So you're saying his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim."
 "I give them twenty-four hours to get out of it. If they can't get out of it by twenty-four hours, it's a land rush."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Suicide" 
---

 - Kramer, in "The Blood" 
---
 "I couldn't raise a kid? C'mon, I love bossing people around."
 - Elaine, in "The Blood" 
---
 "Food and sex. Those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them."

 - George and Jerry, in "The Blood" 
---
 "If even one corpuscle of that blood should find its way across that hall, I will freak out on you. Freak out!"

 - Jerry, in "The Blood" 
---
 "So, how's the fornicating gourmet?"
 "Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft-boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Blood" 
---
 "Why are you calling my parents?"
 "Well, maybe if you called more often I wouldn't have to."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Blood" 
---
"I don't even pay taxes."
 "Yeah, that's easy when you have no income."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Truth" 
---
 "That's karma."
 "No, that's Kramer."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Truth" 
---

 - Jerry, talking about his upcoming audit, in "The Truth" 
---
 "My whole life has been a complete waste of time."
 "And there's so much more to go."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Truth"

---
 "I say stupid things all the time. I can't go two minutes without saying something stupid."
 - George, in "The Truth"

 "Who are they running against?"
 "Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Wizard" 
---
 "I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them out to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first."
 "Haven't you done enough to these people?"
 - George and Elaine, in "The Wizard" 
---
 "And I have horses too."
 "What are their names?"
 "Snoopy and Prickly Pete."
 - George and Mr. Ross, in "The Wizard" 
---

 - Morty Seinfeld, to Jerry, in "The Wizard" 
---
"You were in the Army?"
 "Briefly."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Strongbox" 
---
 "Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?"
 - Jerry, about Elaine's new boyfriend, in "The Strongbox" 
---
 "Apparently I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt."
 - George, having trouble ending a relationship, in "The Strongbox" 
---
 "We found out his super power was lack of money."

 "I don't really have enough room."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Apology" 
---
 "You went to the coffee shop without me? I told you I just wanted to hop in the shower."
 "That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?"
 "Showering. How long's it take you?"
 "Ten minutes."
 "Ten minutes? That's kooky talk."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Apology" 
---
 "Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I could make some changes. Wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just focus!"
 - Kramer, in "The Apology" 
---
 "So she coughed."
 "Coughing? Naked? It's a turn-off, man."
 "Everything goes with naked."
 "When you cough there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion."
 "You spoiled spoiled man. You know how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?"
 "But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing - good. Naked crouching - bad."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Apology" 
---
 "You're probably wasting time working piece-meal, first cleaning one area and then another."

 "But when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Apology" 
---

 - Henke, in "The Apology" 
---
 "Oh yeah yeah, I'm watching you too, but this guy's really showing me something."
 - Kramer, observing men in a gym shower, in "The Apology" 
---
 "This is all in her mind, okay? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah... She's a whacko."
 - Elaine, in "The Apology" 
---
 "Instead of an apology, he was be-boppin' and scattin' all over me."
 - George, about Henke, in "The Apology" 
---
 "I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge."
 - George, at a Rage-aholics meeting, in "The Apology" 
---

 "I think you've got a little rage."
 "I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Apology" 
---
 "What is wrong with my body?"
 "Chicken wing shoulder blades."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Apology" 
---

 "Mmm hmm... I prepared it as I bathed."
 - Elaine and Kramer, in "The Apology"

---
 "I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special."
 - George, in "The Good Samaritan" 
---
 "I said 'God bless you.' Was that so wrong?"
 "The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you,' because as the husband he has the right to first refusal."
 "Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this. Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs."
 "No argument. Unless she's one of these multiple sneezers and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance until she completes the series."
 "Well, I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later and it was also a single."
 "What if she's having an off night?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Good Samaritan" 
---
 "If you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you.' You should say 'You're so good looking!'" - Jerry, in "The Good Samaritan" 
---
 "Oh my god. An affair. It's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis and William Holden. On the other hand, it probably wouldn't cost me any money."
 - George, in "The Good Samaritan" 
---
 "I actually owe it to society to do something about this. I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is."
 "You can't compromise your principles."
 "How am I going to live with myself?"
 "Can't live."
 "I'm not religious but I certainly know where to draw the line."
 "This country needs more people like you."
 "Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry at great personal risk."
 "I believe strongly in that as you know."
 "There should be more people like us."
 "That's why the world's in the shape that it's in."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Good Samaritan" 
---
 "You tell anybody anything and I will carve my initials in your brain dish. I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head."
 - Angela, to Jerry, in "The Good Samaritan"

 - Kramer, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "Got to love the Drake!"
 - Elaine, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "I'm really happy for them."
 "Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them. I mean, I'm glad their happy, but frankly it doesn't do anything for me."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking."
 - Kramer, about Elizabeth, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "This is our best model, the Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like, you're almost glad to be handicapped."
 - Salesman, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "Boy, I'm really starting to dislike the Drake. Hate the Drake!"
 - Jerry, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
 "You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo."
 "Really?"
 "Yeah."
 "I could see that."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Handicap Spot"

 "Am I a hipster-doofus?"
 - Kramer, in "The Handicap Spot" 
---
"This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him."
 - George, in "The Slicer" 
---
 "I haven't had a decent sandwich in thirteen years."
 - Kramer, in "The Slicer" 
---
 "Do you have any idea what it feels like to save someone's life?"
 "Is it anything like hitting a homer in softball?"
 - Dr. Sara and Jerry, in "The Slicer" 
---
 "How was the doctor date?"
 "It died on the table."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Slicer" 
---
 "Saving lives? She's one step above working at the Clinique counter."
 "Dermatologists. Skin doesn't need a doctor."

"What did they do for toilet paper in the Civil War?"
 "What?"
 "I wonder what toilet paper was like in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffel bags?"
 "Everything with you comes down to toilet paper."
 "What?"

 "Alright, then what did they do?"
 "I don't know. Maybe they gave out big loose clumps to all the soldiers."
 "I think it would be nice if there was some sort of historical record of it."
 "Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper during the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack."

 "You really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to, like, Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied, and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working around the clock, thinking about you, having conferences, observing you like the way they did with the elephant man. That's what I'm talking about, because that's the only way you're going to get better."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Pitch"

 "Well, I've been having trouble at home and, uh, I'll work harder. Nights, weekends, whatever it takes."
 "No, no, I don't think that's going to do it. These reports you handed in, it's almost as if you have no business training at all. I don't know what this is supposed to be."
 "Well, I'm just trying to get ahead."
 "I'm sorry, there's just no way that we can keep you on."
 "I don't even really work here."
 "That's what makes this so difficult."

 - Frank Costanza, to Jerry's dad, in "The Shower Head"

 "I'm aware of you."
 - George, to Kramer, in "Good News, Bad News" 
---
 "Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?"
 "What a world that would be if you could just ask a woman what she's thinking."
 "You know, instead I'm like a detective. I gotta pick up clues. The whole thing's a murder investigation."
 - Jerry and George, in "Good News, Bad News" 
---
"I had 'em Jerry. They loved me."
 "And then?"
 "I lost 'em. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting, but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffes and bad puns."
 "Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, say goodnight and walk off."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Burning" 
---
 "You prefer dumb and lazy to religious?"
 "Dumb and lazy I understand."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Burning" 
---
 "Bacterial meningitis... Jackpot!"
 "Gonnorhea? You wanna trade?"
 "Sorry buddy, this is the Hamlet of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions... It's got everything."
 - Mickey and Kramer, in "The Burning" 
---
 "I'm against all 'It's me's'. It's so self-absorbed and egotistical, like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes."
 - George, in "The Burning" 
---
 "Alright, that's it for me! Be good everybody!"
 - George, going out on a high note, in "The Burning" 
---
 "I'm going to make people feel my gonnorhea."
 - Kramer, in "The Burning" 
---
 "Pull the old switcheroo."
 "I think that's 'What's good for the goose is good for the gander.'" "What the hell is a gander anyway?"
 "It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on her."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Burning" 
---
 "Is it a problem that I'm not really religious?"
 "Not for me."
 "Why not?"
 "I'm not the one going to hell."
 - Elaine and Puddy, in "The Burning" 
---
 "My boyfriend said I got gonnorhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit."
 - Sophie, in "The Burning" 
---
 "Don't you even care? This is your company. It's your name on the outside of the building. Speaking of which, the R fell off and all it says now is K-UGER."
 "K-UGER. That sounds like one of those old time car horns, huh? K-UGER! K-UGER!"
 "You are too much, Mr. Kruger. Too much!"
 "Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me!"
 "What? No, no, you're not going out on a high note with me, Mr. Kruger."
 "It's K-UGER!"
 - George and Mr. Kruger, in "The Burning" 
---
"Serenity now! Serenity now!"
 "What is that?"
 "The doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say 'serenity now!'" "Are you supposed to yell it?"
 "The man on the tape wasn't specific."
 - Frank and George, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "I've never seen you mad."
 "I get peeved."
 "Mad."
 "Miffed."
 "Mad."
 "Irked."
 "I would like to see you get really mad."
 - Patty and Jerry, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "You've heard me yell."
 "Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "I'm open. There's just nothing in there."
 - Jerry, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "Starting tonight we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired. The winner gets a Water Pik."
 - Frank, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "What's the matter?"
 "It's Patty."
 "Jerry, you break up with a girl every week."
 "What is this salty discharge?"
 "Oh my God, you're crying."
 "This is horrible. I care."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "I don't know what's happening to me."
 "Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come. It's like Endora's Box."
 "That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora."
 "Yeah, well, she had one too."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "Serenity now, insanity later."
 - Lloyd Braun, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
 "George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure, I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly obvious observations."
 - Jerry, in "The Serenity Now" 
---
"Breaking up is like knocking over a Coke machine. You can't do it in one push. You gotta rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over."
 - Jerry, in "The Voice" 
---
 "I come up with these things, I know they're gold but nothing happens. You know why?"
 "No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains, no..."
 "No, no time! It's all these menial tasks. Laundry, grocery shopping, coming in here and talking to you. You have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?"
 "I could ballpark it."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Voice" 
---
 "You remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries?"
 "Alright."
 "Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience."
 "But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Voice" 
---
 "I've been reviewing Darren's internship journal. Doing laundry, mending chicken wire, high tea with a Mr. Newman?"
 "Well, it all sounds pretty glamourous, but it's business as usual at Kramerica."
 "Far as I can tell, your entire enterprise is little more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken."
 - Dean Jones and Kramer, in "The Voice" 
---
 "You know, Darren, if you had told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the world's energy problems, I would've said you were crazy. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out this window."
 - Kramer, in "The Voice" 
---
"So Puddy wears a man-fur?"
 "He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense."
 "Cheapness is not a sense."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "Now I can peek in and see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies."
 - Kramer, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "Nobody carries wallets anymore. They went out with powdered wigs."
 - Kramer, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "Why are we in Jerry's apartment?"
 "Well, I like to think of this as my conference room. It has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves... and the furniture."
 - Silvio and Kramer, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat."
 "Because you threw it out."
 "No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's insane!"
 "But you did actually throw his coat out the window?"
 "But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows someone stole it, and that's the person who should be held responsible."
 "But that's you."
 "So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "My back is killing me."
 "Of course, because of that wallet! You've got a filing cabinet under half of your ass."
 "This is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "I can't believe we're going dancing."
 "You don't go that often?"
 "No, because it's so stupid."
 - Jerry and Keri, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me."
 - Jerry, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece which seems oddly out of place."
 - Newman, entering Elaine's apartment for the first time, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "Hey Silvio. Just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat."
 "That is your coat?"
 "It sure is."
 "Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention."
 "That's true."
 - Jerry and Silvio, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
 "Hey Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy!"
 - Kramer, in "The Reverse Peephole" 
---
"I feel like an out-of-work porn star."
 - George, commenting on his mustache, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body bag."
 - Kramer, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "Wait a minute. Do I have to ask?"
 "Well, I ran out of butter, so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosey?"
 "Why are you buttering your face?"
 "I'm shaving with it."
 "Oh, Moses smell the roses!"
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "You know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?"
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "I love that bathroom. It's got that high-high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building."
 - George, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us, and I say 'why?'. Are we really so different..."
 "I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman."
 "Damn you Seinfeld. You're a useless pustule."
 - Newman and Jerry, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "Oh man, I think I cooked myself."
 - Kramer, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
 "I'm fried."
 "Technically, you're sauteed. So what are you doing for that?"
 "I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
 "Is that what the doctor said?"
 "I read an article in Bon Apetit Magazine."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Butter Shave" 
---
"Jerry, you got any Tums?"
 "Stomach ache?"
 "I drank too much water in the shower."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Summer of George" 
---
 "So, has the summer of George begun? Or are you still decomposing?"
 "Decompressing."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Summer of George" 
---
 "Can you believe she expected me to squire her around town while the dude sits at home in swaddling clothes?"
 "Do they make swaddling clothes for adults?"
 "It's like she's split the job of boyfriend into two jobs. Except the dude's playing the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beverage."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Summer of George" 
---
 "Listen to me. We're always sitting here. I'm always helping you with your girl problems, you're always helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?"
 "Here."
 "Exactly. Because neither one of us can handle a woman all by ourselves."
 "I'm trying."
 "I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together, at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man."
 "Then each of us would only have to be like a half-man. That sounds about right."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Summer of George" 
---
 "What is so appealing to men about a catfight?"
 "Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other, there's a chance they might somehow kiss."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Summer of George" 
---
"Wait. Those are the clothes from the bag!"
 "The guy never came back."
 "He asked you to watch them, not wear them."
 "I'm still watching them."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "When do you start to worry about ear hair?"
 "When you hear like a soft rustling."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?"
 - Mr. Littman, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "I did something stupid."
 "What'd you do?"
 "Well, I was shaving, and I noticed an assymmetry in my chest hair. And I was trying to even it out. And the next thing I know... Gone!"
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "So you're pretending to be a tourist?"
 "It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here, so it's okay if I'm stupid. And she knows I'm only in town visiting, so there's no messy breakups."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality."
 - Jerry, about Kramer, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "You know, if you take everything I've done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent."
 - George, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
 "We have a bonus ultra-reality stop today. We're going to be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository."
 "We're going to a garbage dump?"
 "And we're off!"
 "You know, I never thought he'd be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close."
 - Kramer, a Tourist, and Jerry, in "The Muffin Tops" 
---
"Kramer, these balloons aren't going to stay filled 'til New Year's."
 "Those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. Only thing is I have to get fired from the Yankees first."
 "You can do that."
 "Of course, but I really want to leave my mark this time. You know, I want to walk away from the Yankees with people saying, 'Wow, now that guy got canned.'" "So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence."
 "Yeah, remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft syrup machine?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "You think people will still be using napkins in the year 2000? Or is this mouth vacuum thing for real?"
 - Kramer, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "What is a barometer exactly?"
 "It's pronounced 'thermometer'."
 - George and Kramer, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "So Jerry, my millennium party is really coming together. Will people be able to breathe under water in the year 2000?"
 "Some of us."
 "I don't want to exclude anybody."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "You can never have too much ice."
 - Newman, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "For me, the next millennium must be Jerry-free."
 - Newman, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "I never thought I'd fail at failing."
 "Oh come on now."
 "I can't do anything wrong."
 "Nonsense. You do everything wrong."
 "Everything?"
 "Everything."
 "You really think so?"
 "Absolutely! I have no confidence in you."
 "Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again."
 "That's the spirit! You suck!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Millennium" 
---
 "I guess I can accept a little Jerry if it gets me a lot of Elaine."
 - Newman, in "The Millennium" 
---
"It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, then screwed you all back together again and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite."
 - Kramer, telling Elaine about her lookalike mannequin, in "The Pie" 
---
 "Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something. If anybody should be rolling their eyes, it is me, at him, about you."
 - Elaine, to a rude store clerk, in "The Pie" 
---
 "It'll be a funky adventure."
 - Kramer, inviting Elaine to scratch his back, in "The Pie" 
---
 "I'm going home to spatula."
 - Kramer, in "The Pie" 
---
 "Do you need some help with that itch?"
 "Madam, I pray you're not toying with me."
 - The cashier at Monk's and Kramer, in "The Pie" 
---
 "A chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help. He wants to get caught."
 - Jerry, in "The Pie" 
---
 "You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ooooo! She's a maestro. The criss-cross, the figure-eight, strummin' on the old banjo. And this wild savage free-for-all where anything can happen."
 - Kramer, in "The Pie" 
---
 "This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel."
 - Jerry, in "The Pie" 
---
 "That's my ass in your window!"
 - Elaine, seeing the mannequin posed in an embarrassing position, in "The Pie" 
---
 "I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some Doublemint gum."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, after they steal her lookalike mannequin, in "The Pie" 
---
 "Poppie's a little sloppy."
 - Jerry, after Poppie is taken away by health inspectors, in "The Pie" 
---
 "Conformity's an obsession with me."
 - George, in "The Pie" 
---
 "Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?"
 "No, that's one for the ages."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Pie" 
---
"I usually last about ten minutes on the stairmaster. Unless, of course, there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour. That's why they call it the stairmaster. You get up there and you stare."
 - Jerry, in "The Implant" 
---
 "Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs."
 - Jerry, in "The Implant" 
---
 "Every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their first date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side."
 "Wrong side?"
 "Yes, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left."
 "He can't go left?"
 "No. I'm leftie, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?"
 "No, we just play defense."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Implant" 
---
 "In the whole world right now there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think on this entire planet that you're one of those three?"
 - George, in "The Implant" 
---
 "You don't touch the nose. You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose. And no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril."
 - Jerry, in "The Implant" 
---
 "Sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool."
 - Elaine, to Jerry, in "The Implant" 
---
 "It's like a sauna in here."
 - Kramer, sitting in a sauna, in "The Implant" 
---
 "This confers upon you instant boyfriend status."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Implant" 
---
 "Did you just double-dip that chip?"
 "Excuse me?"
 "You double-dipped the chip."
 "Double-dipped? What are you talking about?"
 "You dipped the chip, you took a bite, and you dipped again."
 "So?"
 "That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip. Look, from now on when you take a chip, just take one dip and end it."
 "Well, I'm sorry Timmy, but I don't dip that way."
 "Oh, you don't, huh?"
 "No. You dip the way you want to dip, I'll dip the way I want to dip."
 - Timmy and George, in "The Implant" 
---
 "And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular."
 - Sidra, to Jerry, in "The Implant" 
---
"Health cookies? I hate those little dustboard fructose things."
 - Elaine, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "I just can't believe the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?"
 - George, waiting to use the phone, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "You ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They feel so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick."
 - Elaine, getting very hungry, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "If anything happens here can I count on you?"
 "What?"
 "If we decide to go at it."
 "Yeah, I want to get into a rumble."
 - George, still waiting for the phone, and Jerry, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "It's not fair that people are seated first-come, first-serve. It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just walking over there and taking some food off somebody's plate. "I'll tell you what, there's fifty bucks in it for you if you do it."
 "What do you mean?"
 "You walk over to that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything. You eat it, say thank you very much, wipe your mouth, walk away, I give you fifty bucks."
 "What are they gonna do?"
 "They won't do anything. In fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives."
 "Fifty bucks? You'll give me fifty bucks?"
 "Fifty bucks. That table over there. The three couples."
 "Okay, I don't want to go over there and do it and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it."
 "No, no tricks."
 "Should I do it George?"
 "For fifty bucks? I'd put my face in their soup and blow!"
 "Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it."
 - Elaine, Jerry and George, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "We're living in a society!!"
 - George, still waiting for the phone, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat Signal."
 - George, telling how he left a woman's bed, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat. You go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before. They put it in front of you and it was such a delicious and exciting adventure... and now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough."
 - Elaine, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?"
 - Elaine, who just wants to sit and eat, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "This is bad, you don't know. The chain reaction of calls this is going to set off. New York, Long Island, Florida... It's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears."
 - Jerry, worrying about offending his uncle, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "It's just a movie."
 "Just a movie? You don't understand. This isn't Plans One through Eight from Outer Space. This is Plan Nine! This is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "Let's just order it to go. We'll eat it in the cab."
 "Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?"
 "We'll eat it in the movie."
 "Where do you think you're going? You think that they have big picnic tables there?"
 "What do you suggest?"
 "I say we leave now, we go to Skyburger and we scarf 'em down."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "Movie hot dogs? I'd rather lick the food off the floor."
 - Elaine, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
 "I can't go to a bad movie by myself. What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers?"
 - Jerry, in "The Chinese Restaurant" 
---
"Why do I always have the feeling everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?"
 - Jerry, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "Fish... What do they do?"
 "What do *you* do?"
 - George and Elaine, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "I'm trying to live my life!"
 - George, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "You get within fifteen feet of that woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "We're like rats in some experiment."
 - George, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character."
 - Jerry, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "If I am not in front of my building at 6:15 when my parents get there, they are going to put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades."
 - George, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum."
 - George, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "We're not skinheads."
 - Elaine, trying to convince a man to drive her around the garage, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. How does my bladder know I'm in a department store?"
 - Jerry, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "You know, I've been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately, my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place."
 - Jerry, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
 "What's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually."
 "Does that bother you?"
 "Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?"
 "Not at all."
 "You see, now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, because it's people like you who live to be 120 because you're not bothered by it. How can it not bother you?"
 "Well, I once saw this thing on TV with people who are terminally ill. Everyone of them believed that the secret of life is just to live every moment."
 "Yeah, I've heard that. Meanwhile, I'm here with you in a parking garage in Jersey."
 - George and Kramer, in "The Parking Garage" 
---
"I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love."
 - George, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "Hey, Jerry, rub some lotion on my back."
 "Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
 "C'mon, and I'll rub some on you."
 "That's not sweetening the deal."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "This is weird, wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet."
 "Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?"
 "Maybe she's trying to create a buzz."
 "What?"
 "You know, get some good word of mouth going."
 - Jerry, Elaine and Kramer, observing observing a topless Jane, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "Is it me, or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?"
 "I couldn't look. It was like a Pekinese."
 "Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "The train was so crowded, I had to sit in a seat facing the wrong way."
 "Oh, I like that. It's like going back in time."
 - Rachel and Jerry, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "She's got greeting problems."
 - Jerry, about Rachel, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "I saw Jane topless."
 "You saw who what?"
 - Kramer and George, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang, and you jump out first!"
 - George, upset that Jerry saw Jane topless before him, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "I was in the pool! I was in the pool!"
 - George, after Rachel saw him naked, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "Ordinarily I wouldn't mind, but..."
 "But what?"
 "Well, I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold..."
 "Oh, you mean... Shrinkage."
 "Yes. Significant shrinkage."
 "So you feel you were shortchanged."
 "Yes. I mean, if she thinks that's me, she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "Do women know about shrinkage?"
 "What do you mean, like laundry?"
 "No..."
 "Like when a man goes swimming... Afterwards..."
 "It shrinks?"
 "Like a frightened turtle."
 "Why does it shrink?"
 "It just does."
 "I don't know how you guys walk around with those things."
 - George, Elaine and Jerry, in "The Hamptons" 
---
 "I think that you think that a certain something is not all that it could be, when, in fact, it is all that it should be... And more!"
 "I'm sure it is."
 "Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
 - George and Jane, in "The Hamptons" 
---
"Who's gonna be O'Brien?"
 "I'll be O'Brien."
 "Who am I?"
 "You're you."
 "Just me?"
 "Yeah."
 "Okay...."
 "You don't want to be you?"
 "Well, if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?"
 "Like who?"
 "Dylan Murphy."
 "Okay..."
 "What? Now you want to be Dylan Murphy?"
 "Well, I like Dylan."
 "You can be Colin."
 "Colin O'Brien."
 "I'm Dylan Murphy."
 "I'm Colin O'Brien."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Limo" 
---
 "Hello, Ma? It's me. Guess where I am? In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it. All right, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you. How's this - I'm never telling you. I don't care. No. Fine. Never!"
 - George, in "The Limo" 
---
 "I'm telling you, the jig is up."
 "It was a bad jig to begin with. We never should've started this jig."
 "It was a good jig."
 "It was a bad jig. A terrible terrible jig."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "Let's just jump out of the car."
 "We're doing sixty miles per hour."
 "So, we jump and roll. You won't get hurt."
 "Who are you, Mannix?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "You took a cab?"
 "Yeah, so?"
 "How much do you make?"
 "I'm not telling you."
 "Ah, c'mon, I'll tell you how much I make."

 - Kramer and Elaine, in "The Limo"

 "Nice lookin' Luger."
 - Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "Did you see the way she was looking at me?"
 "She's a Nazi, George, a Nazi!"
 "I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi, though."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 I can't run. I have a bad hamstring."
 "How'd that happen?"
 "I hurt it in a hotel room. You know the way they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that, so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "They can't shoot us in the city."
 "Naah, no one's ever been shot in the city."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "There's always been something very strange about Jerry. Always so clean and organized."
 - Kramer, in "The Limo" 
---
 "I know Jerry. He's not a Nazi. No. He's just neat."
 - Elaine, in "The Limo" 
---
 "I may not look like a Murphy, but I act like a Murphy."
 - Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "And the peat...aaah, the peat!"
 - Jerry, in "The Limo" 
---
 "Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian."
 - Kramer, in "The Limo"

 - George, in "The Limo"

"The Dewey Decimal System... What a scam that was!"
 - Kramer, in "The Library"

 "She needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer."
 - Kramer, in "The Library" 
---
 "The library investigator's name is actually Bookman?"
 "It's true."
 "That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named Cone."
 - Kramer and the Librarian, in "The Library" 
---
 "I never figured you for a squealer."
 "Oh, he sang like a canary."
 - Kramer and Jerry, to George, in "The Library" 
---
 "I don't understand lunch. I don't know anything about lunch."
 - George, in "The Library" 
---
 "Instead of saying 'Costanza', he'd say 'Cantstandya, Cantstandya'."
 - George, remembering his high school gym coach, in "The Library" 
---
 "Why do they call it a wedgie?"
 "Because the underwear is pulled up from the back until... it wedges in."
 "They also have an Atomic Wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. It's very rare."
 "Boys are sick."
 "What do girls do?"
 "We just tease someone until they develop an eating disorder."
 - Elaine, George and Jerry, in "The Library" 
---
 "I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella."
 - Lt. Bookman, in "The Library" 
---
 "Let me tell you something, funny boy... You know that little stamp? The one that says New York Public Library? Well, that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole helluva lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before -- flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking... Why's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me.... Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world. What about that kid, sitting down, opening a book right now in a branch of the local library and finding pictures of pee-pees and wee-wees in The Cat in the Hat and The Five Chinese Brothers. Doesn't he deserve better? Look, if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped. Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld... Maybe that's how you get your kicks... You and your goodtime buddies... I've got a flash for you, joy boy. Partytime is over."
 - Lt. Bookman, in "The Library" 
---
 "Columbus? Euro-trash."
 - Jerry, in "The Library" 
---
 "You'd better not screw up again, Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle."
 - Lt. Bookman, in "The Library" 
---
"She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice. But women don't want nice."
 - George, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Why is nice bad? What kind of a sick society are we living in when nice is bad?"
 - George, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "People think I'm smart, but I'm not smart."
 "Who thinks you're smart?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Why is what I do so important? Why must I always be the focal point of attention? Let me just be. Let me live."
 - George, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Hey, I love a good caper."
 - Jerry, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "I meet a lot of women in this jacket. They're attracted to it."
 - Kramer, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Isn't there like a statue of limitations on that?"
 "Statute."
 "What?"
 "Statute of limitations. It's not a statue."
 "No, it's statue."
 "Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "You see everything, don't you?"
 "Well, you know, not everything. I do what I can."
 - Babu and Jerry, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "I had a sandwich in my pocket."
 - George, explaining how he got food on his IQ test, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes around looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am."
 "Of course, I always do."
 "No, no, it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket."
 "Just give it back to him."
 "He'll have to kill me."
 - Kramer, Jerry and Elaine, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist."
 - George, in "The Cafe" 
---
 "Where are people? You see people? Show me people! There are no people!"
 - Babu, after taking Jerry's advice and serving only Pakistani food, in "The Cafe" 
---
"I'll tell you what your problem is... You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think, she's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? Nah, the queen is old-fashioned, likes to stay home, cook, take care of her man, make sure he feels good."
 - George, playing chess, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs."
 - George, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "What is this? What are we doing? What in God's name are we doing?"
 "What?"
 "Our lives! What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men."
 "No we're not. We're not men."
 "We come up with all these stupid little reasons to break up with these women."
 "I know, I know! That's what I do. That's what I do!"
 "Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?"
 "We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty."
 "We're pathetic, you know that?"
 "Yeah, like I don't know that I'm pathetic."
 "Why can't I be normal?"
 "Yes! Me too! I want to be normal. Normal!"
 "It would be nice to care about someone."
 "Yes! Yes! Care!"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "I had a very interesting lunch with George Costanza today."
 "Really?"
 "We were talking about our lives, and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men."
 "So then you asked yourselves, 'Isn't there something more to life?'" "Yes, we did."
 "Yeah, well let me clue you in on something... There isn't."
 "There isn't?"
 "Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, Jerry, marriage? Family? They're prisons! Man-made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning, she's there. You go to sleep at night, she's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. 'Is it alright if I use the bathroom now?!' And you can forget about watching TV while you're eating."
 "I can?"
 "Oh yeah. You know why? Because it's dinnertime, and you know what you do at dinner?"
 "What?"
 "You talk about your day. 'How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know, how about you, how was your day?'" "Boy."
 "It's sad, Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs."
 "I'm glad we had this talk."
 "Oh, you have no idea."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "What if there should be an unfortunate accident?"
 "You're going to rub out the dog?!"
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "Frank, come here!"
 "You come here."
 "Georgie's getting married!"
 "What?"
 "Georgie's getting married!!"
 "Get the hell outta here. He's getting married?"
 "Yes."
 "To a woman?"
 - Estelle and Frank Costanza, in "The Engagement" 
---
 "And she said yes?"
 "Well, it took a couple hours of convincing, but I was persistent."
 - Jerry and George, who asked Susan to marry him, in "The Engagement" 
---
"Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything..."
 "Y'know, I have friends who try to base their whole life on that principle."
 "Really? Who?"
 "Nobody you know..."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Produce section. Very provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling..."
 - Jerry, describing how he met a woman in the supermarket, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Why do I get bananas? They're good for one day..."
 - Jerry, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house I'm doing something."
 - George, explaining why he wants to watch a video at Jerry's place, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "It's like a ski lodge..."
 - Kramer's description of the new look of his apartment after he put up fake-wood wallpaper, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Y'know I remember when I was a kid growing up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe - 'Jerry Jerry Dingleberry', 'Seinsmelled'..."
 - Jerry, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Let me just finish my coffee, and then we'll go watch them cut the fat bastard up."
 - Jerry to Kramer, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint -- it's delicious!"
 - Kramer, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps from above..."
 "Mint?"
 "Those can be very refreshing."
 - The doctor and Kramer, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
 "You don't know my name, do you?"
 "Yes I do."
 "What is it?"
 "It, uh, rhymes with a female body part."
 "What is it?"
 "Mulva..."
 - Dolores and Jerry, in "The Junior Mints" 
---
"I hate rental cars. Nothing ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker."
 - Jerry, in "The Airport" 
---
 "You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!"
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Airport" 
---
 "I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup."
 - George, in "The Airport" 
---
 "I like to stop at the duty free shop!"
 - George and Kramer, singing, in "The Airport" 
---
 "Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!"
 - Kramer to George, in "The Airport" 
---
 "You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We must go forward, not back."
 - George, in "The Airport" 
---
 "You know what? They got the fudge on the bottom - ya see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eating your ice cream."
 - Jerry, eating a sundae, in "The Airport" 
---
 "I never met a man who knew so much about nothing."
 - Tia the model to Jerry, in "The Airport" 
---
 "More anything?"
 "More everything!"
 - Airline attendant and Jerry, who is enjoying his first class meal, in "The Airport" 
---
 "Oh, you got *cookies*!"
 - Elaine, sneaking into first class, in "The Airport" 
---
"You scared me!"
 "It's just me."
 "That's enough!"
 - Jerry and Kramer, bumping into each other in Jerry's apartment, in "The Keys" 
---
 "You were so fast with those keys."
 - Jerry's date, in "The Keys" 
---
 "I broke the covenant of the keys."
 - Kramer, returning Jerry's keys, in "The Keys" 
---
 "I was clinging to those keys, man, like a branch on the banks of a raging river, and now I have let go and I'm free to go with the current, to float, and I thank you."
 - Kramer, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Do you ever yearn?"
 - Kramer, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Having the keys to Jerry's apartment - that kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house it was like a vacation: better food, better view, better TV, cleaner, oh, *much* cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in the twilight, living in the shadows, living in the darkness... like you."
 "Me?!"
 "Oh, I can barely see you, George."
 "Stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out."
 - Kramer and George, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?"
 "I like to get the Daily News."
 - Kramer and George, in "The Keys" 
---
 "I gotta get some new friends."
 - Elaine, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Up here, I'm already gone."
 - Kramer, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Hey Kramer, have you ever killed a man?!"
 "What do you think Junior? You think these hands - they've been soaking in Ivory Liquid?"
 - Punk dude and Kramer, in "The Keys" 
---
 "Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middleman. You were gonna give her her spare keys and she was gonna give 'em to me. So all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours you didn't give her hers because then she would've given them to me. So then I would never have had to ask you for hers so I could get mine."
 "You're right. How did I miss that? (mumbling) Maybe cuz' it's a crock o' sh...."
 "What's that?"
 "Nothing."
 "I heard something..."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Keys" 
---
"This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!"
 - Jerry, in "The Stakeout" 
---
 "So, um, do you date immature men? - Jerry, to Vanessa, in "The Stakeout" 
---
 "When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?"
 - Jerry, in "The Stakeout" 
---
 "Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft..."
 - Jerry, trying to remember where a woman works, in "The Stakeout" 
---
 "Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?"
 - Elaine to Jerry, in "The Stakeout" 
---
 "C'mon, there will be people to mock."
 - Jerry to Elaine, trying to convince her to go to a wedding, in "The Stakeout" 
---
"Not that there's anything wrong with that!"
 - Jerry, denying that he is gay, but not wanting to be seen as anti-gay, in "The Outing" 
---
 "You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!"
 - George, trying to get rid of his current girlfriend, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader? "Living or all time?"
 "All time."
 "Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev."
 "I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?"
 "Lyndon Johnson was uglier than DeGaulle."
 "I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree."
 - Elaine, Jerry and George, in "The Outing" 
---
 "I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-stepping past me: 'C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...'" - Jerry to George, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat."
 "And you get along well with women."
 "I guess that leaves me in the clear..."
 - Jerry, Elaine and George, on why some people might thing Jerry is gay, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since."
 - George, explaining how he and Jerry met, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!"
 - George, trying to convince a reporter that he's not gay, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Ya know, there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!"
 - George, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Guys And Dolls? Isn't that a lavish, broadway musical?"
 "It's Guys And Dolls, not Guys And Guys."
 - Jerry and George, still concerned that people might think they're gay, in "The Outing" 
---
 "Every day it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows what you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films."
 "Yeah. I'm Buck Naked."
 - George's mother and George, in "The Outing" 
---
 "I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay."
 "You're gay?"
 "Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness."
 - George and Allison, as he tries one more tactic to end the relationship, in "The Outing" 
---
"You'll be out before we get the check!"
 - Jerry, to Kramer, who wants in on "The Contest" 
---
 "Hey, lemme ask you a question -- in these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?"
 "I would imagine it's all naked."
 "What about the chambermaids, are they naked too?"
 "They're naked. The gardener's naked. Bellhops. It's one big Nude-O-Rama."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Contest" 
---
 "Too bad you couldn't do *that* for a living... You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you. You could be a big star!"
 - George's mother, chastising her son for treating his body like "an amusement park," in "The Contest" 
---
 "Yeah... butt... butt... Great butt... John John's butt..."
 - Elaine, almost speechless after finding out that John F. Kennedy Jr. will be in her aerobics class, in "The Contest" 
---
 "Good night. Not just a good night... a *great* night!"
 - Jerry to Marla, in "The Contest" 
---
 "Are you Master of your Domain?"
 "I am King of the County. You?"
 "Lord of the Manor."
 "I'm Queen of the castle!"
 - Jerry, George and Elaine, in "The Contest" 
---
 "So, you're still Master of your Domain?"
 "Yes, yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I'm going over to her apartment and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!"
 "Wait, wait wait... Whoa, whoa whoa-- what did you just say?"
 "I can't take it any more! She's drivin' me crazy. I can't sleep, I can't leave the house. When I'm here I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile I'm datin' a virgin, I'm in this contest... something's gotta give!"
 "Do you hear what you're saying? Can you hear it? This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop!? That's the *dumbest* thing I ever heard. I mean, it's incomprehens-- I'm not gonna let you do it!"
 "Well, I'm doin' it. Get out of my way..."
 "No, you can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime. When we were boys looking through our bedroom windows we would think, 'Why can't there be a woman out there taking her clothes off?' And now that wish has come true and you want to... pfffft... throw it away?!"
 - Kramer and Jerry, fighting over the woman across the street, in "The Contest"

 - Elaine, who can't believe that JFK Jr. is interested in her, in "The Contest" 
---
 "The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round..."
 "The woman across the block has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..."
 "The washers on the bus go woosh woosh woosh, woosh woosh woosh..."
 "The woman across the block has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Contest" 
---
 "Where did you get those socks?!"
 "I dunno..."
 "I think those are *my* socks!"
 "How are these *your* socks?"
 "I dunno, but those are *my* socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe and now I don't *have* them anymore!"
 "Oh yeah, that's right, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet, they looked so good to me, I just had to have 'em!!! "Yeah, well, they're *MY SOCKS*!"
 "They're my socks!!!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Contest" 
---
 "You caved?!"
 "It's over!?!"
 "You're out?!?"
 "Oh my God, the Queen is dead!"
 "I figured you'd cruise, at least through the spring..."
 - George and Jerry, reacting with shock at the news that Elaine has dropped out of "The Contest" 
---
 "Elaine... Benes... Kennedy... Junior..."
 - Elaine, fantasizing about marrying JFK Jr., in "The Contest" 
---
"My personal acting technique is working with color. Imagining, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you see that all my lines have a special color. So, I don't memorize language, I memorize colors. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue, and you have a full palette of emotions."
 - Kramer gives a lecture, in "The Trip" 
---
 "I happen to dress based on mood."
 "But you essentially wear the same thing all the time."
 "Seemingly, but within that basic framework there are many subtle variations only discernible to an acute observer that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza."
 "And what mood is this?"
 "This is morning mist."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Trip" 
---
 "I've always been a little nervous about these things. I'm afraid I'm going to step through into another dimension."
 - George, before going through a metal detector, in "The Trip"

---
 "A payphone in L.A. Look, it's a miracle."

---
 "Hello, 911? How are ya?"
 - Jerry, in "The Trip" 
---
 "Hey officer! He's foolin' around back here!"
 - Jerry, while he and George ride around in a "black &amp white", in "The Trip" 
---
 "You know what I've never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid, it was always 'WAAAAAH WAAAAAH' and now it's 'WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO'. Why'd they do that? I mean, did they do some research? Did they find out that WOO-WOO was a more effective siren than WAAAH?"
 "Hey, and what about those English sirens? 'EEE YAAAH, EEE YAAAH, EEE YAAAH, EEE YAAAH'..."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Trip"

 - George, in "The Trip" 
---

 "What am I, made of money? You bunch of deadbeats!"
 - Elaine, stuck with the check again, in "The Subway" 
---
 "Looking for the quotes. Gotta check the quotes. Love a good quote."
 - George, trying to impress a woman, in "The Subway" 
---
 "Big brokerage houses killed my father."
 - George, still trying to impress a woman, in "The Subway" 
---
 "It's ironic."
 "What's ironic?"
 "This. That we've come all this way, we made all this progress, but, you know, we lost the little things, the niceties."
 "No, I mean, what does `ironic' mean?"
 - Elaine and woman on subway, in "The Subway" 
---
 "My luck. I don't talk to a soul on the subway for thirty-five years. I get the best man at a lesbian wedding."

 "You realize, of course, you're naked."
 "Naked, dressed, I don't see any difference."

 "I like a good breakfast."

 "What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take x-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?"
 "I don't know what kind of person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person, a very immature person, a person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time."

 "I have an idea."
 "Yeah?"
 "I show up."
 "Whattya mean, you show up?"
 "I show up! I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back I'm ensconced."
 "Hmmmmm.... Not bad."
 "What's the worst thing that could happen?"
 "Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs."
 "Yeah, so?"
 "Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Barber"

 "What about my massage?!"

 "Yeah, and they say that appearance is not important."
 "Yours or hers?"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Race" 
---
 "Yes, this is a business office, but I'm not a businessman per se. I'm here working for the people. I'm causing dissent, stirring the pot, getting people to question the whole rotten system."
 - George, trying to get a date with a communist, in "The Race" 
---
 "Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out."
 - Kramer, working as a department store Santa Claus, in "The Race" 
---
 "So, what have you been doing with yourself?"
 "I'm a comedian."
 "Well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. What do you do, a lot of that 'Did you ever notice' kind of stuff? It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor."
 "Yeah yeah... Boy, you really went bald there, didn't you? You used to really have a thick full head of hair."
 "Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about 28, right around the time I made my first million."
 - George and Jerry, acting like they haven't seen each other in years, in "The Race" 
---
 "There are no delicatessens under communism."
 "Woah, why not?"
 "Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You've got pastrami and corned beef in one class and salami and bologna in another. That's not right."
 "So you can't get corned beef?"
 "Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe."
 - Kramer and Mickey, in "The Race"

 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Beard" 
---
 "Did you describe yourself to her over the phone?"
 "Yes I did."
 "What did you say?"
 "What do you think I said?"
 "I don't know."

 "Yes, as I see it."

 - Elaine, in "The Beard" 
---
 "Being a woman, I only really have access to the equipment, what, 30-45 minutes a week, and that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment and have access to it 24 hours a day their entire lives?"
 - Elaine, in "The Beard" 
---
 "Well, there's always a place for you on our team."
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Beard"

 "I got rejected by a bald woman."
 - George, in "The Beard"

 "I love the day date... No wine, no shower..."
 - Jerry, in "The Soup" 
---
 "Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. It's newer, which is good, and a ma in front of it. Ma-Newer. When you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing."
 - George, in "The Soup" 
---
 "I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun! Very monastic."
 - Kramer, in "The Soup" 
---
 "The soup counts!"
 - Jerry, to Kenny, in "The Soup"

 "So where's my sneakers?"
 "That's what I want to know."
 "What do you mean?"
 "Well, I saw mom and pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home the place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and pop vanished!"
 "So all my sneakers are gone?"
 "I'm afraid so, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around. They didn't even have any kids."
 "Mom and pop aren't even a mom and pop? "It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored big-time!"
 "So, mom and pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood, establish trust - for 48 years - and then run off with Jerry's sneakers?"
 "Apparently."
 - Jerry, Kramer and Elaine, in "The Mom and Pop Store" 
---
 "For all I know, this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I going to feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?"
 "The way I feel when I go places with you?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Mom and Pop Store" 
---
 "You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?"
 "Yeah, what is he, some sort of an instigator?"
 "That's right, he's a troublemaker."
 - Kramer and George, in "The Mom and Pop Store"

 "And now someone's going to be taking messages for me."
 "From your mother."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Secretary" 
---
 "You're extremely attractive, you're gorgeous. I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name."

 "What, do you think the dry cleaner's your own personal closet?!"
 - Jerry, who caught the dry cleaner's wife wearing his mother's fur coat, in "The Secretary"

 "For our next meal, do you think we should come here, or should we go someplace else? It has its pros and cons. On the one hand, here you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand..."
 "Yeah, yeah, I know, this would be good but it would be the same. But if we go someplace else it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it!"
 - Banya and Jerry, in "The Secretary" 
---
"I wish the flamenco was popular here."
 "Would you do it?"
 "Yes, I think I would."
 "Well, I knew you had an affinity for it because it's the dance of a very proud people."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "I love these people. You can't ask them questions. They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. When huge sums of money are involved then the delicate genius can be disturbed!"
 - George, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "I'm going on record right now, that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her."
 "Why?"
 "Well, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "This is going to be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello."
 "What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?"
 "It's the obligation. You know, as soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better."
 "How about an intercourse hello? How would that be?"
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "The delicate genius has a policy!"
 - George, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "That's just what I need... more kissing."
 - Jerry, in "The Kiss Hello" 
---
 "I'll tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer or whatever you want to be called, the kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing and I don't care what the consequences are!"

 "Well, I heard a noise."
 "What noise?"
 "You know, 'Bleeaahhh'."
 "What 'Bleeaahhh'?"
 "From the bathroom..."
 "Oh, you think she was refunding?"
 "Every time we go out to eat, the minute we're done she's running for the bathroom."
 "So you're concerned?"
 "Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm paying for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet."
 - George, Jerry and Elaine, in "The Switch" 
---
 "Cosmo!"
 - Babs Kramer, revealing her son's first name, in "The Switch" 
---
 "All my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo, Jerry, I'm Cosmo Kramer, and that's who I'm going to be. From now on, I'm Cosmo!"
 - Kramer, in "The Switch" 
---
 "Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the roommate switch. In the middle ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it."
 "They didn't have roommates in the middle ages."
 "How do you know?"
 "Well, for one thing, they didn't have apartments."
 "Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200 somewhere there were two women living together."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Switch" 
---
 "Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank God that you know me and have access to my dementia?"
 - George, in "The Switch" 
---
 "I'm not an orgy guy."
 - Jerry, in "The Switch" 
---
"We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it."
 "So that's here?"
 "Yes, yes, you're like Switzerland."
 "I don't wanna be Switzerland."

 "Don't look at me."
 "Oh, I'm looking right at you, Big Daddy."
 - Kramer, Jerry and Newman, discussing a game of Risk, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "He's a re-gifter."
 - Elaine, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable."
 - George, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "Alright, fine, you sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's going to suffer? The little people. You and George."
 - Kramer, to Jerry, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period."
 "Well, didn't he re-gift the label maker?"
 "Possibly."
 "Well, if he can re-gift, why can't you de-gift?"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "It's Risk. It's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives."
 - Jerry, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "Jerry, I'm a little insulted."
 "You're not a little anything, Newman."
 - Newman and Jerry, in "The Label Maker"

 "I don't trust this guy. I think he re-gifted, and then he de-gifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp."
 - Jerry, about Tim Whatley, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!"
 - Kramer, after catching Newman cheating at Risk, in "The Label Maker" 
---
 "You know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine."
 - Kramer, close to victory in Risk, in "The Label Maker" 
---
"Was he on his death bed?"
 "No, he was on his regular bed."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Scofflaw"

 "I need a new look. I'm stagnating."

 - Gary and George, in "The Scofflaw" 
---
 "I told Jake you said hi."
 "What?! You told Jake I said hi?"
 "Yeah."
 "I can't believe you did that. Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi. When did I say hi?"
 - Kramer and Elaine, in "The Scofflaw" 
---
 "I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
 "It's like a game of tag."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Scofflaw" 
---
 "I don't think I can be that nice."
 "You be nice!"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Scofflaw" 
---
 "What's this? "It's an eyepatch."
 "You look like a pirate."
 "I want to be a pirate."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Scofflaw"

 "I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?"

 "Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
 - Jerry, to George, who is buying a toupee, in "The Scofflaw" 
---
"I got a feeling I'm going to be much smarter than you pretty soon."
 - George, to Jerry, in "The Couch" 
---
 "What do you think Lainey?"
 "Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it."
 "Oh no. I don't want anyone sitting on it."
 - Jerry and Elaine, admiring his new sofa, in "The Couch" 
---
 "If it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate."
 "You're not very bright, are you?"
 "No I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Couch" 
---
 "What is his stand on abortion?"
 "Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice."
 "How do you know?"
 "Because he, well, he's just so good-looking."
 - Jerry and Elaine, discussing her new boyfriend, in "The Couch" 
---
 "My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!"
 "I'm sure it'll come out."
 "I don't care if it comes out. I can't sit on that anymore."
 "Oh, you're making too much of it."
 "Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function. It happens to be on my sofa instead of in the toilet where it would normally be."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Couch" 
---
 "You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert."
 - George, in "The Couch"

"I thought you were happy-go-lucky."
 "No, no, no, I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky."

 "Nothing's finer than being in your diner?"
 - Elaine, reading what Jerry wrote on an autographed photo, in "The Bubble Boy"

 "What are you looking at? You never seen a kid in a bubble before?"
 - Donald the bubble boy, in "The Bubble Boy"

 "It's 3-D art. Computers generate it. Big computers!"
 - Kramer, in "The Gymnast"

 "So let me get this straight. You find yourself in the kitchen, you see an eclair in the receptacle, and you think to yourself, 'What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.'" "No no no no no. It was not trash."
 "Was it in the trash?"
 "Yes."
 "Then it was trash."
 "It wasn't down in. It was sort of on top."
 "But it was in the cylinder."
 "Above the rim."
 "Adjacent to refuse is... refuse."
 "It was on a magazine. And it still had the doily on."
 "Was it eaten?"
 "One little bite."
 "Well, that's garbage."
 "But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt."
 "Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides man and bum. You are now a bum."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Gymnast"

 "I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider other people's feelings."

 "Go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric... What kind of name is that for a clown?"
 - George, in "The Fire"

 "We needed a leader!"
 - George, explaining his hasty exit from the burning apartment, in "The Fire" 
---
 "How do you live with yourself?"
 "It's not easy."
 - A fireman and George, in "The Fire" 
---
 "So you feel 'women and children first' in this day and age is somewhat of an antiquated notion."
 "To some degree."
 "So, basically, it's every man, woman, child and invalid for themselves."
 "In a manner of speaking."
 "Well, that's honest."
 "She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals."
 "Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center she'll see things more clearly."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Fire" 
---
 "There's no precedent, baby!"
 "What, are you using my babies now?"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Fire"

 "After he heckled Toby, she got so upset she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky-toe."
 "That's unbelievable!"
 "Yeah, then after the ambulance left, I found the toe. So, I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice and took off for the hospital."
 "You ran?"
 "No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, 'I got a toe here buddy. Step on it!'" "Holy cow!"
 "Yeah yeah, then all of a sudden this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay's gonna cost her her pinky-toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, 'Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?' I says, 'Well, I got a little prize for you, buddy.' Pwaa! Pwaa! Keeyah! Knocked him out cold!"
 "How could you do that?"

 "You kept making all the stops?"

I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It all became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made in my entire life has been wrong.

"No, I don't have a square to spare. I can't spare a square."
 - Jane, in "The Stall"

 "Mmm... I love this artificial flavoring. I like it better than butter. I think it's more consistent."
 - Jerry, eating popcorn, in "The Stall" 
---
 "Who does she think she is? How dare she! You want me to get the manager? Too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with the flashlights anymore... flush her out."
 - Jerry, reacting to Jane's bad experience in the bathroom, in "The Stall" 
---
 "Elaine, he's a male bimbo. He's a mimbo!"
 - Jerry, on Tony, in "The Stall" 
---
 "George is like a schoolgirl around him."
 - Jerry, in "The Stall" 
---
 "I am down. I am totally down. Mark me down."
 - George, trying to be cool with Tony, in "The Stall" 
---
 "Kramer, my man, what are you doing manana?"
 "Manana? I'm doing nada."
 - Tony and Kramer, in "The Stall" 
---
 "It's a different world when you're with a cool guy."
 - George, in "The Stall" 
---
 "I think that you're in love with him."
 "What? That's ridiculous!"
 "No, I don't think so... You love him."
 "You better be careful on those rocks tomorrow, buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either!"
 - Kramer and George, in "The Stall" 
---
 "Step off, George. I don't want to see you."
 "Me? Step off?"
 - Tony and George, in "The Stall" 
---
 "Ah, you're crazy."
 "Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?!"
 "It's impossible!"
 "Is it? Or is it so possible that your head is spinning like a top?!"
 "It can't be."
 "Can it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?"
 "Alright, that's enough."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Stall" 
---
"I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?"
 "No. It's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "I put a lot of thought into this card."
 "You signed your name and you addressed the envelope. It's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem."
 - Kristen and Jerry, in "The Pledge Drive"

 "A gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom."
 - Kramer, in "The Pledge Drive"

 "If my parents had a mantle, I might be a completely different person."
 - George, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "Do your thing there where you lie to everyone."
 - Jerry, to George, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "What the hell are you doing?"
 "I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it? With your hands?"
 - Exec and George, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "Did you just see what happened here? Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger!"
 "That's how waitress-types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "That finger was meant for me!"
 - George, in "The Pledge Drive" 
---
 "Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman."
 "Well, he looks like a man."

"Hey Elaine, who do you think would win a fight between me and Gorgeous George here?"
 "You mean a real fight fight?"
 "Mano a baldo."
 "George."
 "Why?"
 "George fights dirty."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Pool Guy" 
---
 "I don't have one female friend left."
 "Of course you don't. You're a man's woman. You hate other women and they hate you."
 - Elaine and Kramer, in "The Pool Guy" 
---
 "There's nothing more pathetic than a grown man who's afraid of a woman."
 - Kramer, in "The Pool Guy"

 "This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his worlds collide!"

---
 "I'm getting a new telephone number."
 "How come?"
 "Chicks, man. Too many chicks know my number."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Pool Guy" 
---
 "What else did you two do?"
 "Oh, you know, girly stuff."
 "So, uh, flower shows, shopping for pretty bows, then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight."
 "That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?"
 "Yes, I do."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Pool Guy" 
---
 "You have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world then George Costanza as you know him ceases to exist. You see, right now I have Relationship George. But there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with... Movie George, Coffee Shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George."
 "I love that George."
 "Me too, and he's dying. If Relationship George walks through this door, he will kill Independent George. A George divided against itself cannot stand!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Pool Guy" 
---
"You think she's happy?"
 "Who?"
 "The cashier."
 "Ruthie Cohen?"
 "You know her name?"
 "Sure."
 "I don't think I've ever spoken to her."
 "Maybe that's why she's happy."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Gum" 
---
 "Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch at home?"
 "Well, why go to a fine restaurant when you could just stick something in the microwave... Why go to the park and fly a kite when you could just pop a pill?"
 - George and Kramer, in "The Gum" 
---
 "I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-meiny."
 - Jerry, in "The Gum" 
---
 "She was built in 1922 during the golden age of movie palaces. Minor restorations in 1941, 47, 52, 58, 63, and currently to our present period of time."
 - Kramer, giving a tour of the theatre, in "The Gum" 
---
 "Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies sitting around, chewing gum."
 - Kramer, in "The Gum" 
---
 "That cashier is riding horses on my money."
 "Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around, see if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty-dollar bills around with big lips."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Gum" 
---
 "Well, if it isn't Chesty Larue!"
 - Jerry, to Elaine, in "The Gum"

 - Jerry, in "The Strike"

 "I got him Yankee tickets, he got me a piece of paper saying I've given your gift to someone else."
 "To a children's charity."
 "Don't you see how wrong that is? Where's your Christmas spirit!? An eye for an eye!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Strike" 
---
 "When George was growing up, his father hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday."
 "Oh... and another piece of the puzzle falls into place."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Strike" 
---
 "H&ampH wouldn't let us use their bathroom while we were picketing. It put a cramp in our solidarity."
 - Kramer, in "The Strike" 
---
 "Why didn't you ever mention this?"
 "Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Strike" 
---
 "So, attractive one day, not attractive the next."
 "Have you come across this?"
 "Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome. She's a two-face."
 "Like the Batman villain?"
 "If that helps you."
 "So if I ask her out again, I don't know who's showing up -- the good, the bad, or the ugly."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Strike" 
---
 "Happy Festivus, George!"
 - Elaine, in "The Strike" 
---
 "Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reached for the last one they had, but so did another man. As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way."
 "What happened to the doll?"
 "It was destroyed. But out of that a new holiday was born... A Festivus for the rest of us!"
 - Frank Costanza and Kramer, in "The Strike" 
---
 "At the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around and tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year."
 "And is there a tree?"
 "No. Instead, there's a pole. Requires no decoration. I find tinsel distracting."
 "Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch."
 - Frank and Kramer, in "The Strike" 
---
 "Yamahama, it's fright night!"
 - Kramer, seeing Jerry's date in a bad light, in "The Strike" 
---
"Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?"
 "Actually, that's the definition of selfish."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Secret Code" 
---
 "I am not giving my code to anyone, for any reason!"
 "What if my life depended on it?"
 "If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Secret Code" 
---
 "Now how am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like to be on, Jerry. I would much rather be off."
 "Trust me, you're off."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Secret Code" 
---
 "I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls."
 - J. Peterman, in "The Secret Code" 
---
 "I really should be getting back to my fiance. We had this big fight yesterday and, well, she wants to know my secret code. I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, I would really love to tell someone because it's killing me. You want to know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup. I love that stuff. I pour it in milk. It's my favorite drink."
 - George, talking to Peterman's unconscious mother, in "The Secret Code" 
---
 "I am not giving you my code."
 "I'll bet I can guess it."
 "Yeah, right."
 "Ah, all right, yeah... Let's see... Well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you. You're a word man. Let's go deeper... What kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations. But what tempts you? You're a portly fellow. A bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no... Yours is a sweet tooth. Oh, you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master... The cocoa bean! And only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you. If you could, you'd guzzle it by the gallon... Ovaltine!? Hershey's!? Nestle's Quick!?"
 - George and Kramer, in "The Secret Code" 
---
"Oh great, it's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her. She's totally out of control."
 - Elaine, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "It is all because of that car. See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in. Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an eighteen-hour day!"
 "Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I've known her, worn a bra."
 "That's just shameless."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "Her birthday's coming up, see, so I decided to get her a little present."
 "What are you going to get her?"
 "A very traditional, a very supportive, brassiere."
 "There's nothing subtle about that."
 "No, no, she might just think it's a gift."
 "Have I ever bought you a jockstrap as a gift?"
 - Elaine, Jerry, and George, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "A woman just walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on? She's a menace to society."
 - Elaine, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!"
 - Jackie Chiles, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "Jerry, it's Frank Costanza. Mr. Steinbrenner's here... George is dead... Call me back."
 - Frank, in "The Caddy" 
---
 "Are you going to tell your parents you're still alive?"
 "No. They could use the break."
 - Jerry and George, in "The Caddy" 
---
"I had to take a sick day, I'm so sick of these people."
 - Elaine, on her co-workers, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?"
 "They want to know why they never see you."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Oh, I was unstoppable! Perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella, with just the right amount of grease on the joystick."
 - George, on his gaming skills, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat too?"
 - Elaine, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Well, I'm doing it Jerry. I'm buying that Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever!"
 "Fabulous! See, now you're really doing something."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "You know, the police, they found another victim of The Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo... and it looked a lot like you."
 "Oh come on, there's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me."
 "Not as many as there used to be."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never going to have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
 "Believe me, George, you can count on Slippery Pete."
 - George and Kramer, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs."
 - Jerry, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Guess what I ate!"
 "An ostrich burger?"
 "No, a $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at the Duke and Duchess of Windsor auction. It's the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
 - Elaine and George, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Why don't you put it in the car so I don't accidentally toss it in that dumpster."
 - Jerry, receiving an ugly new hat, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "It's an Entenmann's."
 "Do they have a castle at Windsor?"
 "No, they have a display case at the end of the aisle."
 - Lubeck, the cake appraiser, and Peterman, in "The Frogger" 
---
 "Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still with you?"
 "Umm, as far as I know."
 "Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly-ventilated English basement? "Uhh, I guess I hadn't..."
 "Well, I have a feeling what you are about to go through is punishment enough."
 - Peterman and Elaine, after he discovers that she ate his antique cake, in "The Frogger" 
---
"I miss the days when they made toys that could kill a kid."
 - Jerry, in "The Seven" 
---
 "The only way to really help her is to just let her be."
 - Jerry, about Elaine, in "The Seven" 
---
 "Carrie, you and Susan are cousins... So, your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?"
 "It doesn't make you anything."
 "Well, so legally I could marry your daughter!"
 - George and Carrie, in "The Seven" 
---
 "Are you unhappy with our arrangement?"
 "What arrangement?"
 "Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine."
 "Yeah? Well, let me know when you get something in there and I will."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Seven" 
---
 "I think I really sprained it."
 "Ah, I doubt you sprained it. Maybe you pulled it."
 "Maybe."
 "Did you twist it? You could've twisted it."
 "I don't know."
 "Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it, turned it..."
 "You know what? Why don't you just shut the hell up."
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Seven" 
---
 "A wise man once taught me the healing power of the body's natural pressure points. He sells t-shirts outside the World Trade Center."
 - Kramer, in "The Seven" 
---
 "Seven."
 "Seven Costanza... You're serious?"
 "Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl. Especially a girl... Or a boy."
 "I don't think so."
 "What, you don't like the name?"
 "It's not a name. It's a number."
 "I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all-around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute."
 - George and Susan, in "The Seven" 
---
 "Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service."
 - Jerry, in "The Seven" 
---
 "I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven."
 "Alright, let's see... How about Mug? Mug Costanza. That's original. Or Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl."
 "Alright... You having a good time now?"
 "I've got fifty right here in the cupboard... How about Bisquick? Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce? Maxwell House?"
 "Alright already!!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Seven" 
---
"I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer."
 - Kramer, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "I'm like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I'm having lunch at his desk every day this week... just him and me. He doesn't make a move without me."
 - George, about George Steinbrenner's love of the calzone, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "Beautiful women... Ya know, they get away with murder. You never see one of them lift anything over three pounds. They do whatever they want, whenever they want to, and nobody can stop them."
 "She's like a beautiful Godzilla."
 "And I'm thousands of fleeing Japanese!"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "You've got your shirt in my oven?"
 "Well, I didn't have enough quarters for the dryer, but this is better anyway. And it's more convenient."
 "Oh, for both of us."
 "Yeah, and I have a lot more control. I got a shirt going for ten minutes at 325."
 "What's wrong with your oven?"
 "I'm baking a pie."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "He fires people like it's a bodily function."
 - George, about George Steinbrenner, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "Let me be perfectly blunt. I don't care for you, Costanza. You hang out on the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day laughing it up, wasting your lives."
 - Newman, in "The Calzone" 
---
 "These are terrible."
 "It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone."
 - Elaine and Jerry, smoking bad Peruvian cigars, in "The Calzone" 
---
"I love a good nap. Sometimes it's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning."
 - George, in "The Nap" 
---
 "The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the person."
 "Hey, it's the next best thing to being alone."
 - Jerry and Elaine, in "The Nap" 
---
 "Jerry, look at my eyes."
 "Hmmm... they're a little less beady today."
 "Because I'm refreshed! I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk! I lie on my back, I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible!"
 "Sounds like a real cool fort."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Nap" 
---
 "Well, my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes."
 "What is that smell?"
 "That's East River."
 "You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked, overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?"
 "Technically, Norfolk has more gross tonnage."
 "How could you swim in that water?"
 "I saw a couple other guys out there."
 "Swimming?"
 "Well... floating. They weren't moving much, but they were out there."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Nap" 
---
 "Jerry! Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner's in the room. You gotta help me!"
 "Who is this?"
 - George and Jerry, in "The Nap" 
---
 "It'll be years before they find another place to hide more cheese on a pizza."
 - Elaine, in "The Nap" 
---
"You won't believe this, but as I'm leaving she calls me Susie."
 "I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon, maybe."
 "What am I, a bulimic, chain-smoking stenographer from Staten Island?"
 - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Susie" 
---
 "Wait 'til you see the dress that she's got. It's backless. I'm finally going to make a great entrance."
 "Backless? You gonna back her in?"
 - George and Elaine, in "The Susie" 
---
 "She wants to talk?"
 "She doesn't want to talk, she needs to talk."
 "Nobody needs to talk."
 "Who would want to?"
 - Jerry and George, in "The Susie" 
---
 "My whole life I have never made a great entrance."
 "You've made some fine exits."
 - George and Jerry, in "The Susie" 
---
 "Between you, me, and the lamppost... and the desk, Peggy says this Suse isn't much of a worker."
 "It's Susie."
 "Nevertheless Elaine, the House of Peterman is in disorder."
 - Peterman and Elaine, in "The Susie" 
---
"I notice she's big on the phrase 'yada yada'."
 "Is 'yada yada' bad?"
 "No, yada yada's good. She's very succinct."
 "She is succinct."
 "It's like you're dating USA Today."
 - Jerry and George, talking about Marcy, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "I gotta get on that Internet. I'm late on everything."
 - Jerry, in "The Yada Yada"

 "Are you close with your parents?"
 "Well, they gave birth to me and... yada yada yada..."
 "Yada what?"
 "Yada... yada... yada..."
 - Marcy and George, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. I can gloss over my whole life story."
 - George, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke-telling immunity! He's already got the big two religions covered. If he ever gets Polish citizenship, there'll be no stopping him."
 - Jerry, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "Listen to this. Marcy comes over and she tells me that her ex-boyfriend was over late last night and 'yada yada yada I'm really tired today.' You don't think she'd yada yada sex?"
 "I've yada yada'd sex."
 "Really?"
 "Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisque, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again."
 "But you yada yada'd over the best part."
 "No, I mentioned the bisque."
 - George, Elaine, and Jerry, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism purely for the jokes."
 "And this offends you as a Jewish person?"
 "No, it offends me as a comedian."
 - Jerry and Father Curtis, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines."
 - Jerry, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "You have no idea what my people have been through."
 "The Jews?"
 "No, the dentists. Did you know we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?"
 "Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?"
 - Tim Whatley and Jerry, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "Kramer, he's just a dentist."
 "Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."
 - Jerry and Kramer, in "The Yada Yada" 
---
 "Hi Mr. Abbott."
 "That's Dr. Abbott, DDS. Tim Whatley was one of my students, and if this wasn't my son's wedding day I'd knock your teeth out, you anti-dentite bastard."
 - Jerry and Dr. Abbott, in "The Yada Yada"

 "Hey, what do you call a doctor who failed out of med school?"

 - Kramer, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "I don't want to be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out."
 - Kramer, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "I'm going with jerk store. Jerk store is the line. Jerk store!"
 - George, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "You're a calculating, cold-hearted business woman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats."
 - Kramer, about Elaine, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "Yank it like you're starting a mower."
 - Elaine, on turning off a life support system, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "We only wake you up for the important meetings."
 - Yankee exec, to George, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "Jerk store would've smoked that guy!"
 - George, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma."
 "I didn't know it was possible to not know that."
 - Kramer and Jerry, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And I'm not going to dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!"
 - George, about his comeback line, in "The Comeback" 
---
 "You know, George, the ocean called. They're running out of shrimp."
 "Oh yeah, Riley? Well, the jerk store called. They're running out of you!"
 "What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller."
 - Riley and George, in "The Comeback"
